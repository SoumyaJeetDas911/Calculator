Introduction

Welcome to the Simple Web-Based Calculator project, developed by Soumyajeet Das a 19 year old enthusiast who loves coding. This project aims to create an interactive and user-friendly calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations. With a clean and minimalistic design, this calculator is a perfect tool for beginners learning web development and JavaScript functionality. The project serves as an excellent foundation for understanding DOM manipulation, event handling, and styling using CSS.

Project Overview:

The calculator is built using:

HTML: Provides the structure of the calculator, including buttons and display.

CSS: Enhances the visual appeal with styling, layout, and responsiveness.

JavaScript: Implements the logic for performing arithmetic calculations and handling user interactions.

Features:

Basic arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.

Interactive user interface with button clicks.

Display screen to show user input and results.

Responsive design for various screen sizes.

Error handling for invalid inputs.

Implementation Details:

The project consists of an HTML file that defines the layout, a CSS file for styling, and a JavaScript file that contains the logic. Event listeners are used to detect user inputs, and the calculations are performed dynamically using JavaScript functions.

Future Enhancements:

Implementing advanced functions like square root, percentage, and exponentiation.

Adding a dark mode for better usability.

Creating a history feature to track previous calculations.

Conclusion

This calculator project is a simple yet effective way to practice front-end web development. By building this project, developers can enhance their understanding of JavaScript and improve their UI/UX design skills. Stay tuned for future updates and enhancements!

Happy Coding!
